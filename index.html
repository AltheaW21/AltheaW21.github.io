<h1>TheDrabCollective</h1>
<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>TheDrabCollective is a Latin-Funk-Electronic-Rock group from outerspace and also the ocean. Watching them is the most fun you'll ever have watching a live music performance, even though they're objectively the most boring band around. Most of their instruments are invisible, and many have debated whether they're actually playing their instruments or if it's just a recording from a mysterious interstellar source. Or the ocean. The world is not ready </p>
<h2>Members</h2>

<p>Althea “gleep glorp” Wincek plays an interstellar synthesizer they only manufacture in a secret society that lives in the center of the sun. They were recruited for theDrabCollective because they didn't have anything else going on. Their instrument doesn’t even have a keyboard or anything, it’s like invisible or something. Or so they say.</p>
